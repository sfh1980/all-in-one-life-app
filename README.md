# All-In-One Life Management App

## Overview

An accessibility-focused life management application designed specifically for young adults (18-22) who struggle with daily task organization due to busy lifestyles or neurodivergent conditions like ADHD and ASD. This comprehensive app consolidates essential life management tools into a single, intuitive platform that works seamlessly across web and mobile devices.

## The Problem We're Solving

Existing apps like TickTick, Any.do, MoneyWiz, Todoist, and Cozi contain pieces of what users need, but force them to juggle multiple applications with inconsistent interfaces and overwhelming feature sets. Young adults, particularly those with ADHD or ASD, need a streamlined solution that reduces cognitive load while providing comprehensive life management tools.

## Core Features

- Central hub displaying all life activities: appointments, bills, maintenance reminders, medication alerts
- Offline functionality with local device calendar sync
- Accessibility-focused design for neurodivergent users

### 💰 Simple Financial Management

- User-configurable wellness prompts (movement, hydration, grocery planning)
- Designed specifically for ADHD/ASD attention patterns
- Contextual reminders that adapt to user routines

## Technical Approach

This project serves as both a functional application and an educational journey, following industry-standard development practices:

- **Frontend**: React.js + TypeScript (web), React Native (mobile)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + PostgreSQL
- **Architecture**: Monorepo structure with shared components
- **Methodology**: Agile development with comprehensive testing
- **Focus**: Accessibility-first design and offline-capable functionality

## Educational Mission

Every aspect of this project is documented with detailed explanations of code, methodologies, and industry best practices. This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding modern full-stack development while building a meaningful application that addresses real accessibility needs.
