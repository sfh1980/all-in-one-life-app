# Mobile App Development Workflow
## Budgeting & Scheduling App for Young Adults

### Phase 1: Planning & Research (2-3 weeks)

**Market Research & Validation**
- Research existing apps (Mint, YNAB, PocketGuard, Todoist)
- After a short amount of research, apps like TickTick, Any.do, MoneyWiz, HomeZada, Todoist, MyLifeOrganized, Structured, Cozi... These apps contain parts of what it is I want in my app, but also seem to have many features I'm not yet considering in mine. I am looking for a All-In-One style app that easily tracks things to help with everyday activities. I also want my app to cater to those who have a hard time with real life daily activities due to things like having a busy life, diagnoses like ASD and ADHD that make tracking daily tasks difficult...
- Survey target audience (18-22 year olds) about pain points
- Define unique value proposition focusing on accessibility and neurodivergent-friendly design
- Validate app concept with potential users, including those with ASD/ADHD

**Requirements Gathering**
- Define core features and create comprehensive feature specification
- Create user personas and user stories focused on accessibility needs
- Prioritize features using MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
- Define technical requirements and constraints including offline functionality

**Core Feature Specification**

**1. Unified Calendar System (Must Have)**

- Loan tracking with payment schedules (principal, interest, final payment calculations)
- Basic savings and investment allocation suggestions
- No bank integration initially (future enhancement consideration)

**4. Wellness & Productivity Notifications (Should Have)**
- User-configurable reminder intervals for:
  - Movement/exercise prompts
  - Water intake reminders
  - Grocery planning assistance with scheduling
- Smart grocery list compilation with trip scheduling
- Accessibility-focused notification design for ADHD/ASD users

**5. Bill Management System (Must Have)**
- Photo/manual bill entry with due date tracking
- Recurring bill automation
- Payment reminder notifications
- Loan amortization tracking with user-input loan terms
- Integration with calendar for due date visualization

**6. Lightweight Health Tracker (Should Have)**
- Medication reminder system with customizable schedules
- Water intake logging and reminders
- Mood tracking with simple input methods
- Light exercise tracking (basic activity logging)
- Sleep reminder notifications
- Expandable framework for additional self-care items

**7. Automobile Management (Could Have)**
- Gas mileage tracking based on user's car make/model
- Location-based fuel price integration via API
- Oil change scheduling based on mileage/time intervals
- Maintenance reminder system with user-input vehicle information
- Smart suggestions combined with user-defined maintenance schedules

**Accessibility & Neurodivergent Design Considerations**
- Simplified, distraction-free interface design
- Customizable notification frequencies and types
- Visual and auditory reminder options
- Task breakdown for complex activities
- Flexible scheduling accommodating irregular routines
- Clear, consistent navigation patterns

### Phase 2: Design & Architecture (3-4 weeks)

**User Experience Design**
- Create user journey maps
- Design wireframes for key screens
- Build interactive prototypes (Figma, Adobe XD)
- Conduct usability testing with prototypes

**Technical Architecture**
- Choose tech stack (React Native, Flutter, or native iOS/Android)
- Design database schema
- Plan API architecture
- Define security requirements (data encryption, authentication)
- Create technical documentation

### Phase 3: Development Setup (1 week) âœ… COMPLETE

**Project Infrastructure**
- âœ… Set up version control (Git repository)
- âœ… Configure development environment (Node.js v22.20.0, TypeScript)
- âœ… Set up CI/CD pipeline foundation
- âœ… Choose cloud services preparation
- âœ… Set up project management tools foundation

### Phase 4: MVP Development (8-12 weeks) ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

**Core Features Development - Backend Foundation**
- âœ… Development environment setup
- âœ… Express.js API server with TypeScript
- âœ… Security middleware implementation (helmet, cors, morgan)
- âœ… Environment configuration
- âœ… Basic API endpoint functionality
- [ ] User authentication and onboarding
- [ ] Database setup and models
- [ ] Basic budgeting functionality
- [ ] Bill tracking and reminders
- [ ] Simple appointment scheduling
- [ ] Data persistence and sync

**Development Approach**
- Use Agile methodology with 2-week sprints
- Implement feature by feature
- Regular code reviews
- Unit testing for critical functions

### Phase 5: Testing (2-3 weeks)

**Quality Assurance**
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- User acceptance testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Phase 6: Beta Testing (2-3 weeks)

**User Testing**
- Recruit beta testers from target demographic
- Deploy to TestFlight (iOS) or Google Play Console (Android)
- Collect feedback and analytics
- Iterate based on user feedback

### Phase 7: Launch Preparation (2-3 weeks)

**App Store Optimization**
- Create compelling app store listings
- Design app icons and screenshots
- Write app descriptions
- Set up analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
- Prepare customer support channels

**Legal & Compliance**
- Privacy policy and terms of service
- Data protection compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- App store guidelines compliance

### Phase 8: Launch (1 week)

**Deployment**
